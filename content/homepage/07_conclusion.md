From our analysis, we have learned that the level of recycling in the 59 community districts in New York City can, to a certain degree, be explained by socio-economic factors. We have learned that the level of recycling is in general highest in districts with people of fair socio-economic status whereas the level of recycling is in general lower in districts with people of low or high socio-economic status. 

Perhaps the reason for this pattern is, that both people from the lower class and upper class can have long working hours, as the lower class might need to work several jobs to make ends meet, and as the high-paying jobs of the upper class can also be quite demanding. Thus, these groups of people might not have the surplus energy that recycling requires.

Simirlarly, we see a higher level of recycling in districts with elder people, which is a group that might have more time on their hands, and thus the time required to do recycling. 

These suggestions are, however, only hypotheses and need to be explored more and verified, which could be the subject of future work.
