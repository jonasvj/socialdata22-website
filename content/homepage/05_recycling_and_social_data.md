Now we'll turn to the social aspects of our data. The map below shows a variety of socio-economic factors by district as well as the recycling rates averaged over the timespan of the data. The map also shows the average distance to the nearest public recycling bin by district.

From the map, we see that there definitely is some socio-economic differences between the districts of New York City. For example, we see that the median age, median household income and percentage with a bachelor's degree is much higher in (lower) Manhattan than in Brooklyn and the Bronxs. In contrast the median number of household rooms is much lower in (lower) Manhattan than in the rest of New York. Finally, we see that the median age is higher in the suburbs in the outskirts of the city, i.e. Staten Island and some parts of Queens. 

In general, we see that people living in Bronx and central Brooklyn are worse off socio-economically than most other New Yorkers, whereas people from lower Manhattan are doing quite well socio-economically and people living in Queeens and Staten Island are somewhere inbetween.

Looking at the average recycling rates by district, it seems that people from Staten Island and Queens are recycling the most whereas people from the Bronx and central Brooklyn are recycling the least. The level of recycling in Manhattan is somewhere in between. Thus it appears that the middle class is recycling the most, whereas the lower and upper class are worse at recycling. We also see that elder peopel are recycling more, i.e. the level of recycling seems to be higher in areas with a higher median age.

Finally, it seems that there is not really a correlation between the distance to the nearest public recycling bin and the level of recycling.
