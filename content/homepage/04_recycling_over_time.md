Next, we turn our focus to how the recycling behaviour of New Yorkers have changed over the past few years. In the map below the recycling rate, i.e. the amount of waste recycled as a fraction of the total waste stream, is shown for 17 months throughout 2018 and 2019. The recycling rates for both paper and for metal, glass, plastic & beverage cartons are visualized as well as the total recycling rate. The map reveals that the recycling rate is in general lower for paper than it is for metal, glass, plastic & beverage cartons. But we also see that all three recycling rate increases from the beginning of 2018 to the end of 2019 for most district in the city. Good job New Yorkers!
