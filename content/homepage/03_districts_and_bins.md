To further investigate the availability of public recycling bins in the different community districts, we visualize the distance to the nearest recycling bin for all locations in New York City. Not surprisingly, we see that the distance to the nearest public recycling bin is in general much lower for people living in Manhattan and Northern Brooklyn than it is for people living in suburban areas, such as Queens or Staten Island. We also notice that there is an area in the middle of Brooklyn with almost no recycling bins.
