    "Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and one of the main aspects of green cities. It promotes environmental sustainability by removing raw material input and redirecting waste output in the economic system. Recycling converts the things we throw away into new items, making sure that none of the energy and raw materials used to make them go to waste. It also prevents air and ground pollution, and the release of greenhouse gases that results from dumping waste on landfill sites. But recycling can achieve even more things.\n",
    "Recycling items rather than using raw materials to make new things preserve the planet’s natural resources which, in the face of population growth and growing demand, won’t last forever. Recycling materials uses less energy than extracting, processing, and transporting raw materials to make new products. Think about how raw materials are usually extracted, and what harm these activities might do to the earth. Mining, quarrying, logging, and fracking all cause harm to the planet by causing air and water pollution. These activities can also destroy precious animal habitats. Even more, recycling reduces the amount of waste we send to landfills. When waste sits rotting away in landfills, it leeches toxins into the groundwater and soil, and gives off greenhouse gases like methane as it decomposes, which contributes to global warming. Not only that, if recyclable items are sent to landfills, the precious raw materials, and energy that went into making them are lost. \n",
    "These are only some of the reasons that we find interesting in recycling.\n",

    "##### What is the idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to determine how much waste New York City (NYC) residents recycle and whether recycling varies among different districts in NYC. If a difference does exist, we hope to uncover possible explanations for it. Moreover, different socialeconomic factors are also going to be investigated to se if there is any kind of correlation between recycling and these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are your datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis we choose some different types of dataset to have a more clear view of our problem and to investigate it through different aspects. We will refer to its dataset and the variables later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Recycling data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Recycling-Diversion-and-Capture-Rates/gaq9-z3hz): Monthly data for 2018 and 2019 by district; 145 kB, 1000 rows, 9 variables.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Why is it interesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that recycling levels differ among different districts in New York City, it would be very interesting to learn the reasons/explanations behind these differences. Understanding why recycling is successful in some areas and unsuccessful in others may inspire new initiatives to promote recycling in New York City. In addition to being great for the environment, it would also benefit NYC's residents (recycling reduces pollution, conserves energy, reduces the need for new raw materials, and keeps trash out of landfills). If our findings are meaningful then propably the same paterns would be applied to other cities in the US and/or around the world also. This means that at the end we can generalize our findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project would mostly affect UN SDGs 11 and 12 in a positive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goal is to communicate ouf findings through a public access web-page. With interactive plots we want the users to choose by themselves different socioeconomic factors and see on maps how they affect the recycling behavior of each neighborhood. Plots of data will also be provided to make the user familiar with them as well as other plots that we might find interesting to share when we proceed with our analysis. Last our conclusions will also be presented to complete our story.\n"

    "The behavior of New York residents regarding recycling has been difficult to explain using socioeconomic factors since there is great variability in recycling rates across different districts, which cannot be explained by only socioeconomic factors. Even though we strongly believe that we end up with some usefull patterns. Factors like the educational level and the income per house seemed to follow the same trend with the recycling rates. All districts with more than 40% of their people having a bachelor degree also had recycling rates over 40%. Moreover, if we see the districts with the lowest rec rates they also have one of the highest uneducate percentage to their people and one of the lowest percentage of high educated at the same time. The same pattern follows the yearly income, where the lowest recycling rates districts also have the lowest yearly incomes. Our analysis didnt follow the same results in the avarage house price per district. In that factor although we have some results that can follow the upper trend in some districts, there are others that they dont validate them also. Another intresting pattern was that the avarage bin distance didnt affect allot the recycling rates. The only exception was the BX01 district which had the smallest recycling rates and big avarage bin distance. Apart from that, more that 85% of the districts had an avarage bin distance of less than 1 km which illustrates that NY city has done a good job providing recycling bins close to most of the houses.  \n",

That may seems good for a data analysis but most of them was irrelevant with our problem the thing was that we didnt had any in advance knowlege to help us choose better the variables that we analysis. So we end up choosing with our own criteria this that means that we may have lost some information due to our decisions. "

At this point we have to admit that it was difficult to make a value model and thats because we only had access to 59 observations.

    "Overall, we were able to divide the work fairly equally among the group. Our team was able to acquire the necessary skills to implement those visualisations, and we are happy with the interactive and engaging results. The challenge has been to limit the content of visualisations in order to keep the user's attention - but still allow him to explore. Our best efforts were made, but maybe we could have narrowed it down even more in some areas and expanded the interactive aspects in others."
